# Workout Generator

## Project Overview
The Workout Generator is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help users create personalized workout plans. It leverages Firebase and IndexedDB for online and offline functionality, ensuring that users can manage their workouts seamlessly, whether they are connected to the internet or not.

### Target Audience
This app is designed for fitness enthusiasts and individuals seeking a simple, accessible tool to manage their fitness routines, regardless of their fitness level or goals.

## Features
- **User Authentication**:
  - Secure sign-in and sign-out using Firebase Authentication.
  - User-specific data management ensures workouts are tied to authenticated accounts.
- **Offline Functionality**:
  - Fully functional offline mode using IndexedDB and service worker caching.
  - Data syncs to Firebase automatically when the app goes online.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Mobile-first layout with responsive features implemented using Materialize CSS.
- **Push Notifications**:
  - Notify users about new workouts or updates using Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- **Data Synchronization**:
  - Ensures consistency between Firebase (online) and IndexedDB (offline).
- **Personalized Workout Plans**:
  - Users can generate and manage workouts tailored to their fitness goals and levels.
